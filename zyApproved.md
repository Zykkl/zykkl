## What is the zyApproved Badge?

The zyApproved badge is mostly just a meme. But it's basically a badge that shows that I approve that Documentation or file.

## Why does the zyApproved Badge exist?

It's just some funny stuff but since I'm a mainly .md writer, I enjoy how some people structure their documentations. This badge is here to show my appriciation for it.

## How do I get the badge?

Just send a mail to [zybadge@zykkl.tk](mailto:zybadge@zykkl.tk) and wait for a response. It shouldn't take more than 72 hours to get the badge. If it does I'll let you know in time.
